I, I'm a one way motorway.
I'm the one that drives away and follows you back home.
I, I'm a streetlight shinin'.
I'm a white light blindin' bright, burnin' off and on.
Uh-uh.
It's times like these you learn to live again.
It's times like these you give and give again.
It's times like these you learn to love again.
It's times like these, time and time again.
